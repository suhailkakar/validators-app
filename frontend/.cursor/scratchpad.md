# TAC Restricted Validator Monthly Burn Calculator

## Background and Motivation

The TAC Foundation requires a monthly calculation system to determine how much each restricted validator must burn based on their staking rewards from inflation. This is part of the restricted validator program where validators operate with locked tokens and must burn 80% of their commission rewards (first iteration includes inflation + transaction fees).

**Business Context:**

- Restricted validators have a fixed 90% commission rate
- Of the 90% commission: 10% stays with validator, 80% must be burned
- First iteration scope: Include both inflation rewards and transaction fees (total staking rewards). If needed later, we can refine to inflation-only
- Both claimed and unclaimed rewards must be included
- Monthly reporting cycle for operational transparency

**Technical Context:**

- TAC is an EVM chain built on Cosmos SDK
- Data source: Cosmos SDK REST/gRPC endpoints (primary source of truth)
- Historical data: Tendermint RPC tx search or indexer APIs for convenience
- EVM JSON-RPC is irrelevant for staking data

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### 1. Data Source Integration

- **Challenge:** Accessing accurate validator reward data from Cosmos SDK endpoints
- **Analysis:** Need to query multiple endpoints (`/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/`, `/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/`) and aggregate data correctly
- **Solution:** Use official Cosmos SDK REST API with proper error handling and rate limiting

### 2. Reward Type Filtering ✅ SCOPE CLARIFIED

- **Challenge:** Determining which rewards to include in burn calculations
- **Analysis:** For the first iteration, we will include **total staking rewards** (inflation + transaction fees) as this aligns with what Cosmos SDK distribution endpoints provide naturally
- **Current Approach:** Calculate claimed + unclaimed staking rewards using `/outstanding_rewards` + withdrawal events
- **Future Enhancement:** If needed later, we can refine to inflation-only rewards (would require supply snapshots + voting power calculations)
- **Solution:** Use standard distribution endpoints without complex reward source filtering

### 3. Time Period Accuracy

- **Challenge:** Ensuring accurate monthly calculations including both claimed and unclaimed rewards
- **Analysis:** Need to capture all rewards earned within the specified time window, regardless of claim status
- **Solution:** Query validator outstanding rewards + historical claim events within date range

### 4. Precision and Accuracy

- **Challenge:** Financial calculations require exact precision for burn amounts
- **Analysis:** Token amounts use large integers (base units), must handle decimal conversions carefully
- **Solution:** Use big integer libraries and proper decimal handling for financial calculations

### Full Codebase Analysis Complete ✅

**SYSTEM STATUS:** The TAC Validator Burn Calculator is a comprehensive, production-ready system with both backend calculation engine and frontend dashboard.

### System Architecture Overview

**Backend (Node.js):**

- **Entry Points:** `index.js` (CLI) and `server.js` (REST API)
- **Core Engine:** `BurnCalculator` orchestrates all calculations
- **Data Sources:** Cosmos SDK REST API + Tendermint RPC for transaction history
- **Calculation Logic:** Precise BigInt mathematics for token amounts
- **Frontend:** Next.js dashboard with real-time data visualization

### Key Technical Specifications

1. **Chain Configuration:**

   - Chain ID: `tacchain_239-1` (corrected from docs)
   - RPC: `https://tendermint.rpc.tac.build`
   - REST: `https://cosmos-api.rpc.tac.build`
   - Token: `utac` with 18 decimals (1 TAC = 10^18 utac)
   - Burn Address: `tac1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqph4dsdprc8`

2. **Business Logic:**

   - **Commission Rate:** Strict 90% enforcement (system fails if not exact)
   - **Burn Rate:** 80% of total commission (claimed + unclaimed)
   - **Validator Keeps:** 20% of total commission
   - **Calculation Base:** Total commission only (NOT delegator rewards)

3. **Data Sources:**
   - **Outstanding Rewards:** `/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/validators/{address}/outstanding_rewards`
   - **Commission:** `/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/validators/{address}/commission`
   - **Historical Claims:** Tendermint RPC tx_search for `withdraw_commission` events
   - **Validator Info:** `/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/validators/{address}`

### Critical Implementation Details

**Calculation Flow:**

1. Fetch unclaimed commission from Cosmos API
2. Query historical commission withdrawals from RPC
3. Sum total commission = unclaimed + claimed
4. Calculate burn = 80% of total commission
5. Validate commission rate = exactly 90%
6. Generate comprehensive report with alerts

**Precision Handling:**

- All amounts stored as BigInt strings in base units (utac)

## Lessons

### Development Guidelines

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- Don't use fake API endpoints or fake data, use real APIs and real data for responses

### Project-Specific Notes

- Cosmos SDK REST endpoints are the single source of truth for validator rewards
- EVM JSON-RPC endpoints are irrelevant for staking/validator data
- Precision is critical for financial calculations - use proper big integer libraries
- Both claimed and unclaimed rewards must be included in calculations
- **IMPORTANT**: Current system calculates ALL-TIME commission burns, not monthly
- Burn calculation uses TOTAL commission (claimed + unclaimed) - 80% burn, 20% validator keeps
- Outstanding delegator rewards are NOT included in burn base amount
- **STRICT ENFORCEMENT**: Commission rate must be exactly 90% or system fails
- **LOCKED TOKENS**: Includes validation that delegations come from locked/vesting sources only
- **CLAIMED + UNCLAIMED**: Includes both withdrawn commission and current outstanding commission
