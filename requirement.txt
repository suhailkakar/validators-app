# Requirement

restricted validators must take the staking rewards they earn and burn almost all of it.

- **10% of total staking rewards** always go straight to delegators (untouched).  
- the remaining **90%** goes to the validator (their commission).  

from this validator commission:

- **100% of what the validator receives = 90% of the total staking rewards**.  
- from that, the validator must send **88.888889%** to the TAC burn address.  
  - this equals **80% of the total staking rewards**.  
- the validator keeps the remaining **11.111111%** of their commission.  

both claimed and unclaimed rewards count toward this.

## Example

- total staking rewards = **100 TAC**  
- delegators get **10 TAC (10%)**  
- validator commission = **90 TAC**  

from that 90 TAC:  
- burn = **80 TAC** (≈88.9% of validator’s commission)  
- keep = **10 TAC** (≈11.1% of validator’s commission)
