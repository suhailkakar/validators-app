# Requirements for Restricted Validator Monthly Burn Calculation

## Goal

Calculate how many tokens each restricted validator must send every month for burning.

---

## Restricted Validator Rules

- Validators operate with **locked tokens only**.
- **Validator commission rate is fixed at 90%**:
  - **10%** of rewards go to delegators.
  - From the **90% commission**:
    - **10%** stays with the validator.
    - **80%** must be sent to the TAC Foundation and burned.

---

## Calculation Scope

- **Only count staking rewards from inflation** (newly minted tokens).
- Calculation must include **both claimed and unclaimed rewards**.
- **Timeframe:** Monthly (e.g., “Aug 1 – Aug 31”).

---

## Input Needed

- Official list of restricted validators (addresses provided).
- TAC burn address (where 80% will be sent).
- Data showing how much each validator earned from inflation in the chosen period.

---

## Output

For each restricted validator, provide:
- The **total rewards from inflation** during the month.
- The **exact 80% portion** they must send for burning.
- A report usable by TAC Operations to notify validators.

---

## Operations Process

At the end of each month:
1. Run the calculator.
2. Send results to restricted validators.
3. Validators send their 80% share to the TAC burn address.
4. Ops verifies the tokens arrived at the burn address.
